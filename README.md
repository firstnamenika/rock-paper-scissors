This is a Rock Paper Scissors App made with React for the sake of practicing React, CSS and JavaScript. It is mostly a CSS project.

I am using state hooks to enable scores and different highlights of playcards.

The work is in progress, and I need to rework the app into components, as well as add more styling.
